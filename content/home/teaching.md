**Bachelor/Master theses:**

In general, I am interested in visual memory and attention. Students who are not afraid of seeing computer code or statistics (you do not need to be able to code!) are more than welcome.

Beside that, I have currently these topics available:

* Memory for graphs in RSVP - which features are used when perceiving statistical graphs for brief moments?
* Massive spatial visual memory - we can remember large amount of pictures. What other characteristics can we store about them? 
* Memory for repeating eye movements - can we recognize our own eye movements?
* Validation of test measuring visual literacy - there is a test for measuring visualization literacy. Czech version is more then welcomed
* Resuming questionnaires - when we measure construct using standard tools, do we measure the same thing, if we measure it in parts?
* Typicality and memory: Dollar street - what are cultural differences in memorizing typical rooms
